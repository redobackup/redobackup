# Redo Backup & Recovery

## What happened?

Years ago, the domains `redobackup.com` and `redobackup.org` briefly lapsed, and the registration was scooped up by domain name registrars and offered for a mere 4000.00 USD. As of version 2.0, releases are titled **Redo Rescue**, though we continue to provide support and host resources under the Redo Backup name on [the official SourceForge project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/redobackup/) and other platforms.

## Where can I find it?

All official releases of Redo Backup / Redo Rescue (from its inception in 2010 to today) can be downloaded from the official [SourceForge project page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/redobackup/files). The latest source code (for versions 2.0 and later) is hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/redorescue/redorescue). More information about the project and its features can be found at [the project website](http://redorescue.com/).

* **[Rescuezilla](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla)**: After years without a new release, the source code for Redo Backup 1.0.4 (released in 2012) was forked in 2019, and many long-standing bugs that affected this version were fixed. Rescuezilla's lead maintainer offers outstanding support (even extending to users of past releases of Redo Backup!) and has many ambitious features slated for inclusion, including the aim of becoming a drop-in replacement for Clonezilla. If Redo doesn't suit your needs or you are seeking a more feature-complete solution, we highly recommend checking out [Rescuezilla](https://github.com/rescuezilla/rescuezilla).

## Source for older releases

While the tarballs for source code for versions 1.0.4 and prior are available for download from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/redobackup/files), the **Rescuezilla** project also maintains a meticulously reconstructed [Redo Backup and Recovery source code archive](https://github.com/rescuezilla/redobackup) with extensive information about past releases (far more than simply a mirror of the source code).
